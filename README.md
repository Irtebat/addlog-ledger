It is an object-oriented ES6 JS application that utilizes localStorage as a temporary data site and eventTriggers to update DOM; allowing for data addition and search ***without page relaod***.

## Features
* Browser side DOM rendering

* Search record by name
* Delete record

## Roadmap
I would like to add a feature which allows generation of custom tables catered to specific needs of a business.
